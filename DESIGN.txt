The following methods were not moved to a class:

-Random:
	Reason: generates random numbers, does not need a parameter and used in multiple classes. In my opinion, it makes sense to leave this function in the Functions class.

-getCurrentImage: 
	Reason: The parameter for this function is an object, and in order to make this method in object oriented style, the method must be split into two different methods.
